# Programming_Challenge_Kopernikus
This repository is created to present my solution for the programming challenge of Kopernikus.

# Overview

**Task:** Write a program that will find and remove all similar-looking images in a folder.

**Input:** A path to a folder with images.

**Result:** Remove all non-essential for data collection images.

Non-essential: Duplicated or almost duplicated images that have only 
minor differences from the original that may be considered as non-essential.

**Given:** imaging_interview.py, contains functions for image comparison.

**Rules:** Use only provided functions for image comparison, there is no need to develop your own comparison algorithm.

**Evaluation:** How you write the program to clean the data, not the algorithm you will use.

# Questions

## What did you learn after looking on our dataset?

## How does you program work?

## What values did you decide to use for input parameters and how did you find these values?

## What you would suggest to implement to improve data collection of unique cases in future?

## Any other comments about your solution?
